# 🏠 Student Smart Homes (SSH) – Grocery Coordination Prototype

Student Smart Homes (SSH) is a **web-based prototype** designed to improve grocery delivery coordination among students living in shared accommodations. The system enables students to **compare supermarket prices, share grocery carts, and split delivery costs**, helping reduce expenses while improving convenience.

This project was developed as an **Engineering Design Review (EDR) prototype**, with a strong focus on applying **software engineering best practices** alongside functional system design.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Reduce grocery delivery costs through shared orders
- Enable transparent price comparison across supermarkets
- Support multi-user grocery carts in shared living spaces
- Demonstrate full software engineering workflows from design to deployment

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔐 User authentication (login system)
- 🛒 Shared grocery cart between multiple students
- 📊 Supermarket price comparison dashboard
- 💳 Checkout page with cost breakdown per user
- 🔔 Notifications for cart and order updates

---

## 🖥️ User Interface
The UI was:
- Designed using **Figma**
- Implemented with **HTML & CSS**
- Focused on clarity, accessibility, and usability

Main pages include:
- Login
- Supermarket Dashboard
- Cart Overview
- Checkout
- Notifications
