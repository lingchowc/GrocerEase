For this project, our team “Taylorian” decided on the Engineering Design Review for “Student Smart Homes (SSH)” as proposed by our groupmate Wey Herng. This system focuses on enhancing a grocery delivery coordination application that would essentially be integrated within an SSH Console Table and App. The concept would include the introduction of a shared grocery list, from stores partnering with SSH, amongst students, which could ultimately reduce cost due to the shared delivery fee. 

Goals: Users will be able to connect to partnered supermarkets so that users have access to the latest price and information of the products including promotional discounts.
Goals: Users are able to see who added what to the order and the total cost of the order and cost of each item labeled.
