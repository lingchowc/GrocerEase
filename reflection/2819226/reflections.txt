Reflection on 2885593
Name : Suet Ling Chow ( Software Development Team Leader )

Working with Chow has been an extremely interesting experience. As the software development team leader, she demonstrated exceptional leadership by effectively guiding our team through the assignment. She ensured tasks were distributed equally among all members and that our assignment is carried out smoothly. One of Chow's standout qualities is her excellent technical knowledge, especially her outstanding coding skills. She not only generated clean and efficient code, but she also willingly shared her knowledge with the rest of us. I really appreciate her help when I encountered difficulties with the code, she suggested practical solutions and explained them clearly which improved my understanding and allowed me to enhance my technical skills. In addition, when I shared my ideas for UI design, she was open to discussion and focused, creating a collaborative and inclusive environment.

To further improve our teamwork in the future, I would suggest Chow consider delegating more opportunities for decision-making to other team members. While her guidance is invaluable, encouraging others to take initiative could further improve our collective growth. Overall, Chow’s leadership, coding expertise, and collaborative spirit have contributed significantly to the success of our group project. I believe that under her guidance, our future projects will continue to be productive and successful.
