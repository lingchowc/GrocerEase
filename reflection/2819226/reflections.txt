During the assignment, Chow acted as the Software Development Team Leader, she showed her excellent leadership and effectively guided our team throughout the assignment by ensuring that tasks were distributed equally among all members and that everything was carried out smoothly. 

Chow has a very solid understanding of technical concepts, such as HTML, PHP, and CSS. She not only generated clean and efficient code, but she also willingly shared her knowledge with all of us. I really appreciate her help when I encountered difficulties with the code. She was always there to help and make some useful suggestions, then explained them clearly to ensure that I fully understood the solutions, which also allowed me to improve my technical skills. In addition, when I shared my ideas regarding to the UI design, she was always open to discussion and created a collaborative and inclusive environment.

While her guidance is invaluable, encouraging others to take initiative could further improve our collective growth. Overall, Chow’s leadership, coding expertise, and collaborative spirit have contributed significantly to the success of our group project.
